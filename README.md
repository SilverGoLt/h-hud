# H-HUD (Minimalistic and Responsive) ESX Only
H-HUD is a Status UI created by Harokis#0677, and is published for free to the FiveM Community

## How to modify?
Currently, the UI is written with HTML, TailwindCSS, JQuery, LUA. But I'm planning to move it in the future to alpine.js which is a really light JS API that has better performance than JQuery.

### Usage and License
You can use the UI for free on your server, you're not allowed to take my work and sell it in any way of form, this is a free resource created for people that don't know how to make a simple UI and displays simple ways of creating UI's using TailwindCSS and JQuery.
